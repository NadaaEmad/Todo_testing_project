*****Create method****

Test cases (From graph coverage and data flow):
[1,2]	  ==> todo is null
[1,3,4]	  ==> todo isn't null and the title is empty
[1,3,5,6]	==> todo isn't null, the title isn't empty and the description is empty
[1,3,5,7,8]	==> todo isn't null, the title isn't empty and the description isn't empty

======================================================================
 *****Read method****
 
Test cases (From graph coverage and data flow):
[1,2]	==> id is null
[1,3,4]	==> id is empty
[1,3,5,6,8,9] ==>id not null nor empty but todo is null
[1,3,5,6,7,5,6,8,10] ==>normal flow

=====================================================================================
 *****Update method****

Test cases (From graph coverage and data flow):
[1,2,3,5,7,9]	==>Normal flow
[1,2,3,5,8]	==>id is empty
[1,2,3,6]	===>id is null
[1,2,4]	==>id doesn't exist

=====================================================================================
*****Delete method****

Test cases (From graph coverage and data flow):
[1,2,3,5,7]	==>>Normal flow
[1,2,3,5,8]	==> empty id
[1,2,3,6]	==> null id

*****List all method****

Test cases (From graph coverage and data flow):
[1,3] ==> todos null
[1,2] ==> todos not null

============================================================================================
 *****List Completed method****
	
Test cases (From graph coverage and data flow):	
[1,2,4,5,6,8,4,9] ==> one completed todo (list of todos has only one todo and it's completed)
[1,2,4,5,7,9]	==> list of todos has only one todo and it's not completed
[1,2,4,5,6,8,4,5,7,9]	==> list of todos has one completed and one not completed
[1,2,4,5,6,8,4,5,6,8,4,9]	==> list of todos has two completed todos
[1,3]	 ==> todos null
